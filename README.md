# NETCHAT Server, in Rust.

# Deprecation warning
> ⚠️This is now deprecated. It is useless because TINET got discontinued and we have Matrix/IRC anyway.

NETCHAT is a chatting server that uses TINET for authentication.  
I've chosen to rewrite it in Rust for better performance and just because I like Rust.

The original server is [here](https://github.com/tkbstudios/netchatserver)

## How to use
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/tkbstudios/netchat-server-rust/releases) and run it.  
It'll fetch the latest stable default config file if it's the first run.  
Edit the config file carefully and start the server back up.  

> Don't forget to allow the port you use (default: 2052) through your firewall if you have one.

## Security warning
> ⚠️ This server is still in rewrite progress, please do not expect a safe server yet, make sure to set up your firewall correctly to prevent attacks on your machine!
> 
> Ideally, please only use this server if you know what you're doing.
